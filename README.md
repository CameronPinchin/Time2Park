# Time2Park
 Smart parking availability detector. 

Time2Park is a personal project aimed at utilizing a Raspberry Pi and Pi-Cam 
to analyze the parking spots directly out front of my house. 

This project aims to build upon my knowledge of Python and SQL to improve my proficency as a programmer, in addition to it being an interesting personal project.
