# Time2Park
 Smart parking availability detector. 

Time2Park is a personal project aimed at utilizing a Raspberry Pi and Pi-Cam 
to analyze the parking spots directly out front of my house. 

This project aims to build upon my knowledge of Python and SQL to improve my proficency as a programmer, in addition to it being an interesting personal project. 

This project will be deployable for anyone who has a Raspberry Pi and Picamera. You just need a location that has visible access to parking parking spots in a similar fashion that I have. 

From my living room window, there are three spots directly infront of my house where you can park. If this differs from your situation, then you will need to adjust the rois defined in car_detection.py accordingly. To learn more about ROIs and how you would adjust them, I will link the openCV documentation below.
